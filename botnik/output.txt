                          BAD PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL

To have files see as they are: cat reads the input buffers and transfers
the value to a typewriter.

When an argument is less than 8, and relocation instructions are not yet
implemented, the file will be renamed to some of its contents. This feature
can be used to generate an error. Commands which exist can only be invoked
via some sort of characters written in the terminal.

Files may be removed if there is no input for a time. Therefore, the process
to die is a new feature.

Permission to write may be denied. In this case, the correct results may be
found by searching the stack. Thus: the default shell is garbage.

Bugs should be found before use of the software. In the event they are not,
the first occurence of a bug can often disturb the user. There is a good
chance the program will not exist, so it is illegal to be in a user's mailbox.

If an entry is separated from the standard input, the current working
directory may be deleted. In the event of unfortunate removal, consideration
should be given to the idea of free range tapes.

This is a little kludgy, so no effort has been put into debugging. Bugs
should be reported to /dev/null. Debugging is for others to do.

Diagnostics: Not even once.

If it occurs that there are problems, I have died. Otherwise, contact should
be simple. Context is important.
