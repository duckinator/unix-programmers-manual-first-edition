      NAME        atof -- ascii to floating
      SYNOPSIS    jsr   r5,atof;  subr
      DESCRIPTION atof will convert an  ascii stream to a floating number returned
                  in fr0. The subroutine subr is called on r5 for each character
                  of the ascii stream.  subr should return the character in r0.
                  The first character not used in the conversion is left in r0.
                  The floating point simulation should be active in either
                  floating or double mode, but in single precision integer mode.

      NAME        getw, getc, fopen -- buffered input
      SYNOPSIS    mov   $filename , r0
                  jsr   r5,fopen; iobuf

                  jsr   r5,getw; iobuf
                  (word in r0)
      DESCRIPTION These routines are used to provide a buffered input facility.
                  iobuf is the address of a 134(10) byte buffer area whose
                  contents are  maintamed by these routines. Its format is:
                  ioptr:   . =. +2 / file descriptor
                        .=.+ 2     / characters left in buffer
                        .=.+ 2     / ptr to next character
                            . = .+28./ the buffer
                  fopen  should be called initially to open the file. On return,
                  the error bit (c—bit) is set if the open failed. If fopen is
                  never called,  get will read from the standard input file.
                  getc returns the .next byte from the file in r0. The error bit
                  is set on end of file or a read error.
                  getw returns the next word in r0. getc and getw may be used
                  alternately; there are no odd/even problems.
                  iobuf must be provided by the user; it must be on a word
                  boundary.

      BUGS        for greater speed, the buffer should be 512 bytes long.
                  Unfortunately, this will cause several existing programs to
                  stop working.

      SYNOPSIS    may   $filename , r0

                  jsr r5,flush;  iobuf
      DESCRIPTION fcreat creates the given file (mode 17) and sets up the buffer
                  iohuf (size 134(10) bytes); putc and putw write a byte or word
                  respectively onto the file; flush forces the contents of the
                  buffer to be written, but does not close the file. The format
                  of the buffer is:
                  iobuf:.=.+2      / file descriptor
                        .=.+2      / characters unused in buffer

                        .=.+128.   / buffer
                  fcreat sets the error bit (c—bit) if the file creation failed;
                  none of the other routines return error information.
                  Before terminating, a program should call flush to force out
                  the last of the output.
                  The user must supply  iohuf, which should begin on a word
