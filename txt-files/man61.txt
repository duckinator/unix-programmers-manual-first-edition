        NAME       bj -- the game of black jack
        SYNOPSIS   /usr/games/bj
        DESCRIPTIONBlack jack is a serious attempt at simulating the dealer in
                   the game of black jack (or twenty—one) as might be found
                   in Reno.
                   The following rules apply:
                     The bet is $2 every hand.
                     A player ‘natural’ (black jack) pays $3. A dealer
                     natural loses $2. Both dealer and player naturals is a
                     ‘push’ (no money exchange).
                     If the dealer has an ace up, the player is allowed to
                     make an ‘insurance’ bet against the chance of a dealer
                     natural. If this bet is not taken, play resumes as
                     normal. If the bet is taken, it is a side bet where the
                     player wins $2 if the dealer has a natural and loses $1
                     if the dealer does not.
                     If the player is dealt two cards of the same value, he
                     is allowed to ‘double’. He is allowed to play two
                     hands, each with one of these cards. (The bet is
                     doubled also; $2 on each hand.)
                     If a dealt hand has a total of ten or eleven, the
                     player may ‘double down’. He may double the bet ($2 to
                     $4) and receive exactly one more card on that hand.
                     Under normal play, the player may ‘hit’ (draw a card)
                     as long as his total is not over twenty—one. If the
                     player ‘busts’ (goes over twenty—one), the dealer wins
                     the bet.
                     When the player ‘stands’ (decides not to hit), the
                     dealer hits until he attains a total of seventeen or
                     more. If the dealer busts, the player wins the bet.
                     If both player and dealer stand, the one with the
                     largest total wins. A tie is a push.
                   The machine deals and keeps score. The following questions
                   will be asked at appropriate times. Each question is
                   answered by x followed by a new line for ‘yes’, or just
                   new line for ‘no’.
                         means ‘do you want a hit?’
                   Insureance?
           11/3/71                                BJ (VI)
                   double down?
                   Every time the deck is shuffled, the dealer so states and
                   the ‘action’ (total bet) and ‘standing’ (total won or
                   loss) is printed. To exit, hit the interrupt key (DEL) and
                   the action and standing will be printed.

        NAME       chess -- the game of chess
        SYNOPSIS   /usr/games/chess
        DESCRIPTIONChess is an attempt at computer chess. The program ‘speaks’
                   in algebraic chess notation. The initial board
                   configuration in this notation is as follows:
                     8 R N B Q K B N R
                     7 P P P P P P P P
                     6 - * - * - * - *
                     5 * - * - * - * -
                     4 - * - * - * - *
                     3 * - * - * - * -
                     2 p p p p p p p p
                     1 r n b q k b n r
                       a b c d e f g h
                   A move is specified by the ‘from’ co—ordinate followed by
                   the ‘to’ co—ordinate. Thus the white P—K4 move would be
                   ‘e2e4’. The black P—K4 would be ‘e7e5’.
                   The following commands are recognized by the chess
                   program:
                   move
                     Make the move if legal. The program does not keep track
                     of who is to play. The move is made for what ever side
                     is specified.
                   move x
                     Make the move regardless of legality. This is a good
                     way to either set up a desired situation or to cheat.
                     The initial move ‘e2e8x’ is a winner.
                   mw
                     The program will compute and make a move for the white
                     pieces.
                   m
                     The program will compute and make a move for the black
                     pieces.
                   lab
                     Set the level parameters to a and b, where a and b are
                     numbers between 0 and 9. The initial settings are 2 and
                     8. The first parameter increases computation time
                     rapidly while the second parameter only increases
                     computation exponentially. Currently move times run
                     from 20 seconds to 10 minutes. It was hoped that these
                     numbers would be usefully related to the program’s
                     competence.

                   An interrupt (DEL) will pull the program out of its
                   computation. If it is trying to make a move, the best move
                   to date is made.
